Traditional Chinese wisdom teaches that 萬事起頭難--the first step is always the hardest (yes, it sounds lamer in translation. Sounds super wise in Chinese). So here I am, somewhat reluctantly cranking out my first post. Many credits to a certain Captain Kirk who both pushed me to do this directly and who inspired me to start this website in the first place. Also a wise teacher of mine once acknowledged that all great writings are born out of imitation (plagiarism) of some form. So I guess beginning my original blog with words of others is, in a way, a step toward greatness ;)

This blog serves as a place where I try to put my often scattered thoughts into coherent sentences, and where I hope that my un-tested ideas, theories, philosophies, will be read and challenged by fellow netizens. Below are excerpts of a few thoughts that recently came into my mindspace:

1.

Was reading Isaiah Berlin's "The Hedgehog and the Fox", an essay on Tolstoy's theory of history. Haven't finished reading it yet, so can't comment on how I feel about Tolstoy's theory of history. But what did really made an impression on me was this opening:

   "There is a line among the fragments of the Greek poet Archilochus which says: 'The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.'"
   
Berlin went on to interpret that the hedgehog could be alluded to those who think and relate everything to "a single central vision, one system", while the fox could refer to those who are able to "seize upon the essence of a vast variety of experiences and objects" without trying to fit them into any one unifying system.

The paragraph struck me because--other than it being beautifully written--I found myself so firmly categorized into the hedgehog type--I, consciously or unconsciously, have emerged as a convergent thinker. Looking back I find most things that I'm interested in, or that I sought out to learn, or to understand, to always end up revolving around some central principle or purpose that I hold onto. At times it feels limiting, however. And doesn't existential crises strike hedgehogs more easily, when a single doubt about one's unified vision is sufficient to render a life's work worthless?

Regardless, the categorization made me realize how I do appreciate the "foxes" around me. Perhaps it's a compensating mechanism, I do think I'm drawn to divergent thinkers. I appreciate how they find meaning in many things, rather than constantly feeling the need to "make sense" of things. I appreciate how for them there quite simply doesn't have to be a single answer to any question, there could be many. Sometimes I do forget that.

Spent the better part of the summer attempting to get a better idea of what the current state of innovation looks like in Hong Kong. I read up on innovation policy, went to multiple talks on FinTech, and met a bunch of people in the industry. Funnily enough, what began as a simple thesis turned more and more blurry with increased information and exposure. I started out assuming a few things: that innovation is Hong Kong's economic frontier, that Hong Kong's startup/entrepreneurship scene would be better than where it currently is given more governmental support, i.e. assuming a lack of governmental efforts and a positive potential for more governmental intervention. The more I talked to the people in the industry, however, the fuzzier I feel. I heard mixed comments about the current state of innovation--some think it's performing well, others think it's crap. It's difficult for me to get an objective assessment, without knowing the right parameters. So this project is on hold while I clear up my thoughts and keep absorbing information. Strongly felt are these ancient wise words from the Taoist Master Zhuang: 吾生也有涯，而知也無涯。以有涯隨無涯，殆已；已而為知者，殆而已矣！

Recent events at home in Hong Kong have triggered many thoughts. This summer alone we have seen abducted booksellers taken from Hong Kong by mainland Chinese security--a move in clear violation of the limits of power set out in the Basic Law, and a blatant assault on freedom of expression and publication. And then not long ago we saw barely disguised political censorship imposed on the legislation council race. Potential candidates were banned from the race not for any procedural or criminal violation, but for what they have said in public or on social media. Words, mere words were the sole evidence that the government produced to disqualify potential candidates. Um... sorry, but clauses 26 and 27 of the Basic Law states clearly that all Hong Kong citizens have the right to be elected? and that we all enjoy the freedom of speech and assembly and all? Um... so who's in violation of the Basic Law again?
Beyond anger of the blatant injustices being conducted right in front of our eyes is a drowning wave of helplessness. What are we to do when none other than our own government turns against us? Who are we to turn to when injustices are being done to us? We have no voice in international society, and our government, instead of listening to our dissenting voices, shuts us down, betrays us, sprays tear gas on us. As a citizen of Hong Kong I feel oppressed everyday, voiceless, helpless.
So much of who I am is tied to this strong faith that there is a way out, that I can be part of a movement that leads the way, not by inciting a revolution, but by reasonable negotiations, rational analysis, constructive propositions. But what if all that my dreams are built upon boils down to a bargain with the devil? I struggle to see light at the end of the tunnel. But I still believe there's light.
