The world is going through a wave of identity crises: Donald Trump and Brexit are only two most outstanding examples of how identity shifts can, now more than ever, shape global and domestic politics in dramatic ways. I will probably revisit this topic later for I do have plenty of thoughts and feelings on it.
However, today, my thoughts are more concerned with how identity politics shape this side of the globe: Asia.

I suppose identity politics is usually taken somewhat less seriously in Asia, partly because politics as the West knows it doesn't really exist here. China is not a democracy, nor is Hong Kong. Politics here is hence often seen as a top-down game rather than a bottom-up one. I do believe, however, that there is power in understanding the role of identity in Asian (Chinese) politics.

1) China
Identity politics in China is an extremely intriguing case. While the Communist regime has attempted throughout the last decade to become increasingly rationalist and institutionalized, Xi seems to be increasingly pushing for a politics based on identity: agendas such as the China Dream and the increasing encouragements to idolize Xi are telling examples.
It has confounded many scholars as to how the CCP manages to maintain an authoritarian rule despite its--ehh--less-than-clean record on suppression of human rights and limitations on its people's liberties, for the classic liberal theories would predict that cries for social and political freedom almost automatically follow economic freedom (which Socialist China has an abundance of).
Reading Isaiah Berlin the other day, however, gave new insights to this question. For the craving for recognition as an equal human being is a distinct desire from that for freedom, either in the negative of positive sense.
By this logic, it is not difficult to see how so long as the CCP is successful in consolidating its tale of how its regime delivered China from "a hundred years of humiliation", its rule may well be secure.

This understanding of "identity politics" in China may be ever more important, as China is becoming increasingly confident in projecting its influence both in the region and beyond. In the wake of a Trump administration, there is little doubt that China will play an even more assertive role in international politics (a Trump presidency quite simply represents the desire of the American people to turn its government's attention inwards, rather than outwards; to "make (domestic) America 'great again'" means essentially to shrink America's involvement overseas, thus by extension giving more leeway for China to do as it pleases). Whether it will take on the identity of a new, responsible global power, or one of a victim seeking for glory once possessed and now lost--that should be the key to understanding, predicting, and responding to China.

2) Hong Kong
Identity politics is releveant to Hong Kong in a slightly different manner. China doesn't really have an identity crisis--it's proud of its new strength and eager to flex its muscles. Its only "crisis", or rather dilemma, is in how to reconcile itself with the existing world order and its ambitions to be a major world power.
Hong Kong actually has an identity crisis. Neither its government nor its people can quite make up their mind regarding whether Hong Kong is part of China, not part of China, or whether it matters at all. Well, I lie. The government is quite clear on its stance, but has been doing a terrible job convincing its people to feel the same.
This conflict in identity between the government and the people is fundamental to understanding Hong Kong politics: a big, sad mess, where nothing productive or beneficial ever gets done. 
The solution for Hong Kong lies in looking beyond identity politics--identity politics is only productive or meaningful, when both the identity of the governed is represented by the governing, whether by means of representative voting, or by other channels of gauging the people's hearts and minds. In Hong Kong, the governing assigns identity to the governed--because that's the way the power hierarchy works here, unfortunately.
Understanding that, the only way out is in acknowledging that the one real, common identity to all Hong Kongers is simply that we all build our lives on this land.


To be continued and substantiated.
