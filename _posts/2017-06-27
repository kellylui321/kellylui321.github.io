I’d like to start a project.

Climate change is one of the top issues in my mind. I see it as one of the most difficult global challenges that we face in our lifetime—yes, in our lifetime—and one that I care deeply about, because I love nature—I grew up reading Chinese literature that is full of the beauty of the running rivers, the lush greens of mountains, and the crisp bird chirps. And then I was hooked on British literature with all its idyllic descriptions and luxurious poetry of nature. John Keats? Ode to a Nightingale? That was my ultimate definition of romance. But I digress.

I have thought about climate change a whole lot, for a long time. But it wasn’t until my recent trip to Lombok, Indonesia, where I spent time in its beautiful waters, seeing coral reefs for my first time and hanging out with the fish, that I felt strongly just how much we will be losing out, if all this natural beauty were to be lost.

My brother put it remarkably well once, that environmental protection is truly a misnomer, for we are not protecting the “environment”—the environment lives on no matter what we do, by definition—but rather protecting ourselves.

 So I have decided to finally take some action on this issue, and to finally stop feeling like a hypocrite every time I say I care about the environment.

One of the greatest challenges that we all face is the massive wave of helplessness that swallows us, whenever we hear about environmental protection and climate change. At this point we all know about the importance of recycling, blah blah blah, but coupled with news of melting glaciers and unprecedented floods, it all seems like such nonsense.

Even more so, most of us would find it extremely difficult to abandon the convenience (oh evil convenience) that an energy(fossil fuel)-based lifestyle brings. Case in Point: every time I walk by Starbucks, I hate myself for not having a tumbler. Another case in point: who doesn’t love Amazon?????

So my project is this: becoming mindful of environmentally friendly behaviors, making changes one step at a time, and documenting it for all the similar people out there (people who truly do love the environment but just fall that tiny bit short of taking actions on it). 

My goal is to find the most economic and logical ways to live a more environmentally friendly life, document my progress, and to produce a guide so you don’t have to go through the whole thought process. Hopefully I can even find an environmentally friendly way to deliver all that you need conveniently to you.

Let’s start with building a baseline: recording the steps that I normally take in a full week and my carbon footprint.
Then: identifying areas that I can comfortably do in a more environmentally friendly way and changing them.
Finally: Document steps I’ve taken and reduction I’ve achieved.

I’m excited to see what comes out from this!
